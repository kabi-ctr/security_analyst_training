# 🛡️ Security Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my **Security Analyst Portfolio** — a curated collection of hands-on projects, notes, and case studies designed to demonstrate readiness for a **Security Operations Center (SOC) / Blue Team** role.

This repository focuses on **practical, job-relevant skills**: analyzing logs, triaging alerts, responding to incidents, mapping activity to **MITRE ATT&CK**, and applying **lightweight machine learning** techniques to support threat detection and security analytics.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Showcase **practical SOC skills** including alert triage, incident response, and basic threat hunting using realistic scenarios.
- Demonstrate the ability to **document security work clearly** through incident reports, playbooks, and structured case studies.
- Bridge prior **data engineering / machine learning experience** with security analytics and detection engineering use cases.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The structure follows a **skill-area-based layout** commonly used in SOC portfolios, allowing reviewers to quickly navigate to areas of interest such as incident response, threat detection, or analytics.

## 🔧 What You’ll Find in Each Section

### `01-foundations`
Concise notes on **networking, Linux, and SOC operations** written from a blue-team perspective. Includes commonly used commands, log examples, and triage-focused explanations.

### `02-incident-response`
End-to-end **incident response write-ups** (e.g., phishing, brute-force attacks) along with playbooks that demonstrate structured investigations, evidence handling, and reporting.

### `03-threat-detection-ml`
Small, focused **machine learning projects** (phishing email classification, login anomaly detection) showing how analytics can support SOC decision-making. Emphasis is placed on **interpretability, limitations, and false positives**, not just model accuracy.

### `04-threat-intelligence`
Mapping observed activity to **MITRE ATT&CK techniques** and performing basic **IOC analysis** using public threat intelligence sources and open-source tools.

### `05-interview-prep`
Curated **SOC interview questions and case studies** derived directly from the projects in this repository, designed to help translate hands-on work into clear interview narratives.

---

## 🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated

- Log analysis and basic threat hunting across **authentication, network, and email** data sources.
- Incident response documentation, including **timelines, evidence collection, containment actions, and lessons learned**.
- Application of **MITRE ATT&CK**, IOC enrichment, and simple analytics to support investigations.
- Clear communication of technical findings for both **technical and non-technical stakeholders**.

---

## 📌 Intended Audience

This portfolio is intended for:
- SOC / Junior Security Analyst roles  
- Blue Team / Detection & Response teams  
- Interviewers seeking evidence of **hands-on security thinking**, not just certifications

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

This repository is actively evolving as I continue learning and refining my SOC and security analytics skills. Feedback and discussion are welcome.
